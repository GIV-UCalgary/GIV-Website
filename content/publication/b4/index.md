abstract: "In this chapter, we provide a thorough discussion on Digital Earth with particular focus on Discrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS), which are a standardized representation of the Earth. We describe the necessary components of a DGGS, such as the underlying 2D representation, indexing system, projection, and cell types. We also discuss a selection of well-known public and commercial DGGSs followed by current DGGS standards."
