abstract: "In this paper, we propose a method for creating freeform surfaces from sketch-annotated images. Beginning from an image, the user sketches object boundaries, features, and holes. Sketching is made easier by a magnetic pen that follows strong edges in the image. To create a surface from the sketch, a planar mesh is constructed such that its geometry aligns with the boundary and interior features. We then inflate to 3D using a discrete distance transform filtered through a cross-sectional mapping function. Finally, the input image is applied as a texture to the surface. The benefits of our framework are demonstrated with examples in modeling both freeform and manufactured objects."
