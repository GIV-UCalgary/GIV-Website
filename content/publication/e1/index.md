abstract: "The field of sketch-based interfaces and modeling (SBIM) is concerned with developing methods and techniques to enable users to interact with a computer through sketching-a simple, yet highly expressive medium. SBIM blends concepts from computer graphics, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Recent improvements in hardware, coupled with new machine learning techniques for more accurate recognition, and more robust depth inferencing techniques for sketch-based modeling, have resulted in an explosion of both sketch-based interfaces and pen-based computing devices. Presenting the first coherent, unified overview of SBIM, this unique text/reference bridges the two complementary research areas of user interaction (sketch-based interfaces), and graphical modeling and construction (sketch-based modeling). The book discusses the state of the art of this rapidly evolving field, with contributions from an international selection of experts. Also covered are sketch-based systems that allow the user to manipulate and edit existing data-from text, images, 3D shapes, and video-as opposed to modeling from scratch. Topics and features: reviews pen/stylus interfaces to graphical applications that avoid reliance on user interface modes; describes systems for diagrammatic sketch recognition, mathematical sketching, and sketch-based retrieval of vector drawings; examines pen-based user interfaces for engineering and educational applications; presents a set of techniques for sketch recognition that rely strictly on spatial information; introduces the Teddy system; a pioneering sketching interface for designing â€¦"
