abstract: "Digital Earth frameworks provide a tool to receive, send and interact with large
location-based data sets, organized usually according to Discrete Global Grid Systems
(DGGS). In DGGS, an indexing method is used to assign a unique index to each cell of a
global grid and the data sets corresponding to these cells are retrieved or allocated using
this unique index. There exist many methods to index cells of DGGS. Toward facility,
interoperability, and also defining a “standard” for DGGS, a conversion is needed to translate
a data set from one DGGS to another. In this paper, we first propose a categorization of
indexing methods of DGGS and then define a general conversion method from one indexing
to another. Several examples are presented to describe the method."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
