abstract: "The most common graph visualization techniques still use nodelink layouts; where the nodes represent the entities and the links represent the edges or relationships between the entities. In nodelink layouts, the issues of edge density, edge crossings and general edge congestion remain one of the major challenges. In this paper, we introduce a new graph layout: Node-Ring layout. Our layout was inspired by concentric circles, which have appeared in art in numerous diverse situations. We have particularly noted Australian dot painting and Hundertwasser’s paintings. The change in layout∗ e-mail: ketemad@ ucalgary. ca† e-mail: sheelagh@ ucalgary. ca‡ e-mail: samavati@ ucalgary. ca is that instead of the edges being represented as links (lines between nodes), we represent them as colored rings located inside the node. These concentric edge-rings are colored according to the node to which they connect. Nodes can be sized according to their weight, and for weighted edges a circular section whose angle is proportional to the weight can be drawn instead of a full ring. This alternative layout has no hassle with edge crossings or cluttering."
