abstract: "A better silhouette for a mesh can be rendered if we take into account the stability of edges inside and outside the current silhouette. Using the dot product between the normal and the viewing direction we can measure this stability. This gives us two types of edges: silhouette and non-silhouette and an associated stability of each. We apply this classification and stability measure to achieve several different styles of rendering as well as temporal frame coherence."
