abstract: " The Atlas of Connectivity Maps (ACM) is a data structure designed for semiregular meshes. These meshes can be divided into regular, grid-like patches, with vertex positions stored in a 2D array associated with each patch. Although the patches start at the same resolution, modeling objects with a variable level of detail requires adapting the patches to different resolutions and levels of detail. In this paper, we describe how to extend the ACM to support this type of adaptive subdivision. The new proposed structure for the ACM accepts patches at different resolutions connected through one-to-many attachments at the boundaries. These one-to-many attachments are handled by a linear interpolation between the boundaries or by forming a transitional quadrangulation/triangulation, which we call a zipper. This new structure for the ACM enables us to make the ACM more efficient by dividing the initial mesh into â€¦"
