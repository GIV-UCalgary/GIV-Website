abstract: " In this paper, a new adaptive Loop subdivision algorithm is introduced. Adaptive subdivision refines specific areas of a model according to user or application needs. Our algorithm extends the specified area such that when it is adaptively subdivided, it produces a smooth surface with visually pleasing connectivity. As adaptive subdivision is repeated, subdivision depth changes gradually from one area of the surface to another area. This smooth transition is analogous to anti-aliasing."
