Muqarnas is a mesmerizing element of Islamic architecture that exhibits intricate geometry. It has been widely used in many countries in middle east, and southern parts of Europe since 11th century.

In this project, we have studied the geometry and structure of muqarnas and explore methods and techniques to create virtual models of this structures.
