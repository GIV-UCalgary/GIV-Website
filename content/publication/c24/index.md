abstract: "In this paper we describe Persian floral patterns and explore techniques for animating them. We present several approaches for this dynamic recreation: visualizing pattern symmetries, illustrating their design process, and simulating plant growth. For creating a pleasant illusion of a never-ending movie, we also explore an infinitely cycling effect for self-similar patterns. The construction of animating patterns is started by interactive modeling of plant elements using NURBS. We then use procedural techniques to control the animation."
