abstract: "Sketching and doodling are two techniques commonly used by choreographers to design a dance sequence.
These sketches usually represent the trajectory of the dancer
in the scene. A set of annotations can be used to differentiate the
various dance movements. In order to have more control over
the choreographed dance, a 3D animation is preferable. This
paper presents a novel sketch-based approach to assist dance
choreographers authoring dance motions in a 3D environment.
The proposed approach allows a choreographer to story board
a dance using stick figure sketches of a dancer. Inspired
by traditional choreography, a set of simple annotations is
introduced for ballet. These annotations help to retrieve and
blend ballet ‘mini-motions’ in order to create a synthesized
dance. To build the mini-motions, we have analyzed and
processed several ballet movements available in a MoCap
database."
