abstract: "The amount of information collected about the Earth has become extremely large. With this information comes the demand for integration, processing, visualization and distribution of this data so that it can be leveraged to solve real-world problems. To address this issue, a carefully designed information structure is needed that stores all of the information about the Earth in a convenient format such that it can be easily used to solve a wide variety of problems. The idea which we explore is to create a Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS) using a Disdyakis Triacontahedron (DT) as the initial polyhedron. We have adapted a simple, closed-form, equal-area projection to reduce distortion and speed up queries. We have derived an efficient, closed-form inverse for this projection that can be used in important DGGS queries. The resulting construction is indexed using an atlas of connectivity maps. Using some simple modular arithmetic, we can then address point to cell, neighbourhood and hierarchical queries on the grid, allowing for these queries to be performed in constant time. We have evaluated the angular distortion created by our DGGS by comparing it to a traditional icosahedron DGGS using a similar projection. We demonstrate that our grid reduces angular distortion while allowing for real-time rendering of data across the globe."
