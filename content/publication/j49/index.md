abstract: "Digital Earth frameworks deal with data sets of different types collected from various sources. In order to effectively store, retrieve, and transmit these data sets, efficient multiscale data representations that are compatible with the underlying structure of the Digital Earth framework are required. In this paper, we describe several such techniques and their properties; namely, how to represent data in the multiscale cell hierarchy of a DGGS or in the multiscale hierarchy of a customized wavelet transform. We also discuss how these techniques can be tuned to be applicable to the A3H DGGS."
