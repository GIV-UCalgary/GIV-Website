abstract: "User interfaces in modeling have traditionally followed the WIMP (Window, Icon, Menu, Pointer) paradigm. Though functional and very powerful, they can also be cumbersome and daunting to a novice user, and creating a complex model requires considerable expertise and effort. A recent trend is toward more accessible and natural interfaces, which has lead to sketch-based interfaces for modeling (SBIM). The goal is to allow sketches—hasty freehand drawings—to be used in the modeling process, from rough model creation through to fine detail construction. Mapping a 2D sketch to a 3D modeling operation is a difficult task, rife with ambiguity. To wit, we present a categorization based on how a SBIM application chooses to interpret a sketch, of which there are three primary methods: to create a 3D model, to add details to an existing model, or to deform and manipulate a model. Additionally, in this paper we …"
