// To be updated

## The workflow
This is the main repository of our lab's website which contains the sources. This website is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and using the [Academics theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/).

The sources are mainly [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files (.md format). You may edit these sources either directly from Github or by cloning the project and editing locally in your machine. 

Whenever you push something to this repository, a build process will be triggered automatically and builds the website (i.e. generates HTML CSS files) and pushes the built site into two other repositories. This process takes roughly 6 minutes.

We have a review stage in this process; a copy of our website is online at Github pages here: https://givgroup.github.io/
When build ends, you can see the changes in the above link in ~15 min. (This time is for CDN caches to break)

Because of this workflow, you don't need to install Hugo on your machine. The only thing you need is simple text editors. 


## How to update website
I will write some documentation on the following topics:
- Updating your profile and your picture
- Adding papers
- Adding and updating news
- Adding and updating project pages

In the meantime, you can ask me if you wanted to update the site and/or have a look at Hugo documentation and also Academic theme for Hugo documentation in the following links:

- https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/
