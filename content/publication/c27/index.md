abstract: "Nonlinear projection is a current area of research in computer graphics. It provides a meeting place between science and art. After describing motivations for use of nonlinear projection, we provide a brief survey of different techniques for nonlinear projection described in computer graphics literature. We then examine several cases of how and when artists choose to use nonlinear projection, as opposed to perspective projection, and how these might be achieved with current computer graphics techniques. Lastly, we provide a synopsis of the Flexible Projection Framework and then describe how it was used in a collaborative project between an artist and a computer scientist."
