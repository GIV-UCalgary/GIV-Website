abstract: "We present a novel sketch-based system for the interactive modeling of a variety of free-form 3D objects using just a few strokes. Our technique is inspired by the traditional illustration strategy for depicting 3D forms where the basic geometric forms of the subjects are identified, sketched and progressively refined using few key strokes. We introduce two parametric surfaces, rotational and cross sectional blending, that are inspired by this illustration technique. We also describe orthogonal deformation and cross sectional oversketching as editing tools to complement our modeling techniques. Examples with models ranging from cartoon style to botanical illustration demonstrate the capabilities of our system."
