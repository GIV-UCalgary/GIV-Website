abstract: "Sketching on paper is a quick and easy way to communicate ideas. However, many sketch-based systems require people to draw in contrived ways instead of sketching freely as they would on paper. NaturaSketch affords a more natural interface through multiple strokes that overlap, cross, and connect. It also features a meshing algorithm to support multiple strokes of different classifications, which lets users design complex 3D shapes from sketches drawn over existing images. To provide a familiar workflow for object design, a set of sketch annotations can also specify modeling and editing operations. NaturaSketch empowers designers to produce a variety of models quickly and easily."
