# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "My primary research focus is on 3D reconstruction and the application of computer vision techniques in digital global grid systems. When I'm not busy with my research, I spend about 90% of my time on one of these activities:

 

- Reading materials on computation theory, and free will, and diving into captivating books like GEB.
- Writing snippets on my understanding of the topics living in my head.
- Keeping active with running/swimming - (poke me on Strava if you're active too!)
- Getting creative in the kitchen, trying out new recipes!"
