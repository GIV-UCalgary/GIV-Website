abstract: "Recently, Runions and Samavati [7] proposed Partion of Unity
Parametrics (PUPs), a generalization of NURBS which replaces B-spline
basis functions with arbitrary Weight-Functions (WFs) while preserving
affine invariance. A key problem identified by Runions and Samavati was
the identification of classes of weight-functions which are well-suited to
geometric modeling. In this paper, we propose a class of WF based on
bump-functions, which arise in the study of smooth, non-analytic manifolds. These give rise to a class of C
âˆž curves with compact-support,
which we call CINPACT splines. The WFs are similar in form to B-spline
basis functions, and are parameterized by a degree-like shape parameter.
We examine the approximating and interpolating curves created using
the proposed class of WF. Furthermore, we propose and demonstrate a
method to specify the tangents and higher order derivatives of the curve
at control points for CINPACT and PUPs curves."
