abstract: "This paper describes a sketch-based method for augmenting geometric meshes with variable-scale sharp features. Such mesh editing operations provide a powerful way to exploit an artist’s natural sketching abilities for content creation using existing mesh libraries. We use adaptive subdivision to refine the mesh only in the region of the features and embed the augmentations into the input mesh, maintaining a unified representation. Moreover, we present new templates for adaptive subdivision that minimize the high-valence vertex count while maximizing the number of quadrilaterals in the new mesh, thereby improving its quality."
