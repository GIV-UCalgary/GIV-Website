abstract: " Digital terrain models can be created by gathering a set of measurements from geometric objects. For various reasons, these models may be incomplete and thus fail to meet the requirements defined by their potential applications. In this work, we develop a novel multiresolution approach to repair the voids commonly found in digital elevation models (DEM). We use the overall shape and structure of the surrounding terrain to build a smooth patch for the void. Then, using a multiresolution approach obtained from reverse Chaikin subdivision, we extract the low-scale characteristics from the surrounding terrain and apply them to the smooth patch. The results demonstrate that our approach is effective in synthesizing models with realistic characteristics. "
