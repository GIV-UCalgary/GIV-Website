Similar to previous works by Stam, Zorin, and Schroder that achieved forward subdivision only, our averaging operators involve only direct neighbours of a vertex, and can be configured to generalize B-Spline multiresolution to arbitrary topology surfaces. Our subdivision surfaces are hence able to exhibit $C^d$ continuity at regular vertices (for arbitrary values of $d$) and appear to exhibit $C^1$ continuity at extraordinary vertices. Smooth reverse and non-uniform subdivisions are additionally supported.},  keywords={Geometric Modeling;Subdivision;Multiresolution},  doi={10.1109/TVCG.2020.2972877},  ISSN={1941-0506},  month={},}
