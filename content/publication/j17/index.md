abstract: "We describe a multiresolution method for rendering curves that is based on exact reproduction of artistic silhouettes and line hand-gesture styles. Using analysis based on reverse subdivision, we extract examples from both scanned images of line-drawn artwork and interactively-sketched input and apply these styles to the arbitrary strokes of new illustrations. Our algorithms work directly with the extracted discrete point data using fast and simple local and global multiresolution filters, and we support the use of styles with gaps or discontinuities. Our results show how this technique can capture the complex contour drawings of landscape elements, allowing users without drawing skills to easily reproduce them."
