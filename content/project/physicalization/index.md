## **Introduction**
Physicalization in computer graphics is the technique of converting abstract digital data into physical, tangible representations. This approach allows users to engage with data in a more intuitive and interactive manner by leveraging physical objects to convey information. It has applications across various fields, such as scientific visualization, education, and design, where complex data can be better understood through physical interaction.
