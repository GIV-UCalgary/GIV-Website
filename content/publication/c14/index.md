abstract: "We present an illustrative visualization system for real-time and high quality rendering of clinical volumetric medical data. Our technique is inspired by a medical illustration technique for depicting contextual close-up views of selected regions of interest where internal anatomical features are rendered in high detail. Our method integrates four important components: decimation of original volume for interactivity, B-spline subdivision for super-resolution rendering, fast gradient quantization technique for feature extraction and GPU fragment shaders for gradient dependent rendering and transfer functions. Examples with clinical CT and MRI data demonstrate the capabilities of our system."
