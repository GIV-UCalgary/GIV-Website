abstract: " Modern area preserving projections employed by cartographers and geographers have closed forms when transitioning between the sphere and the plane. Inversions - from the planar map to the spherical approximation of the Earth - are slower, requiring iterative root finding approaches or entirely undetermined. Recent optimizations of the common Inverse Snyder Equal Area Polyhedral projection have been fairly successful, however the work herein improves it further by adjusting the approximating polynomial. An evaluation against the original and improved optimizations is provided, along with a previously unexplored real-time analysis."
