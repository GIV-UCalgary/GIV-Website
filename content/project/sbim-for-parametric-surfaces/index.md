In this Sketch-based modeling project, free-form parametric surfaces are created using just a few strokes. The technique is inspired by the traditional illustration strategy for depicting 3D forms where the basic geometric forms of the subjects are identiﬁed, sketched and progressively reﬁned using few key strokes. We introduce two parametric surfaces, rotational and cross sectional blending, that are inspired by this illustration technique. We also describe orthogonal deformation and cross sectional oversketching as editing tools to complement our modeling techniques.
