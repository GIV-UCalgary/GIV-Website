abstract: "Energy systems are under pressure to transform in
order to address concerns about climate change. The modeling
and visualization of energy systems can play an important
role in communicating the costs, benefits and tradeoffs of
energy systems choices. We introduce a visualization tool
that provides an interface for exploring time-varying, multiattribute and spatial properties of a particular energy system.
The tool integrates several visualization techniques to facilitate
exploration of a particular energy system. These techniques
include flow diagram representation to show energy flow, 3D
interaction with flow diagrams for expanding viewable data
attributes such as emissions and an interactive map integrated
with flow diagrams for simultaneous exploration of spatial
and abstract information. We also perform level of detail
exploration on flow diagrams and use smooth animation across
the visualizations to represent time-varying data. As a means
of preliminary evaluation, we have included feedback on this
tool from our energy system collaborators."
