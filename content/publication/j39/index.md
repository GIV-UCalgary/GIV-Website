abstract: " In this article, we present the construction of an interactive multilevel focus+context visualization framework for the navigation and exploration of large-scale 2D and 3D images. The presented framework utilizes a balanced multiresolution technique supported by a balanced wavelet transform (BWT). It extends the mode of focus+context visualization, where spatially separate magnification of regions of interest (ROIs) is performed, as opposed to in-place magnification. Each resulting visualization scenario resembles a tree structure, where the root constitutes the main context, each non-root internal node plays the dual roles of both focus and context, and each leaf solely represents a focus. Our developed prototype supports interactive manipulation of the visualization hierarchy, such as addition and deletion of ROIs and desired changes in their resolutions at any level of the hierarchy on the fly. We describe â€¦"
