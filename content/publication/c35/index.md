abstract: "Muqarnas is a mesmerizing 3D feature of Islamic architecture that exhibit intricate geometry. Such designs are composed of several basic structures combined in successive layers, producing complicated 3D surfaces. In this paper we propose a new approach for interactive modelling of muqarnas based on their layered structure. As a guidance for the modeling workflow, floor plans are used. We also discuss how to edit the resulting models and how to automatically generate new forms."
