abstract: " Adapting natural phenomena rendering for real-time applications has become a common practice in computer graphics. We propose a GPU-based multi-band method for optimized synthesis of “far from coast” ocean waves using an empirical Fourier domain model. Instead of performing two independent syntheses for low- and high-band frequencies of ocean waves, we perform only low-band synthesis and employ results to reproduce high frequency details of ocean surface by an optimized iterative up-sampling stage. Our experimental results show that this approach greatly improves the performance of original multi-band synthesis while maintaining image quality."
