abstract: "We present a Sketch Based Interface that allows non-expert users to create an animation with sound from a drawing on paper. Current animation programs may be daunting for novice users due to the complexity of their interfaces. In our work, users first draw a sketch on paper. Such a sketch is then processed by our tool and converted to an animation that includes sound. We do this process by means of a predefined set of 2D symbols and words that represent 3D characters, animations, and associated sounds. We present three studies of the proposed system, one related to the accuracy of the recognition process, another on the convenience of our system, and a third on the effect of sound on the final animation."
