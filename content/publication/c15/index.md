abstract: " Subdivision surface intersections can be costly to compute. They require the intersection of high resolution meshes in order to obtain accurate results, which can lead to slow performance and high memory usage. In this paper we show how the strong convex hull property can lead to a method for efficiently computing intersections at high resolutions. Consequently, the method can be used with any subdivision scheme that has the strong convex hull property. In this method, a bipartite graph structure is used to track potentially intersecting faces."
