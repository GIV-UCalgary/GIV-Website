abstract: "In this paper we propose a new watermarking approach for 3D polygonal meshes. In the field of multimedia watermarking, mesh watermarking is less advanced than image or video. The main difficulty is due to the irregular structure of 3D meshes that makes them more vulnerable to attacks. To address this issue, we introduce a new criterion-accessibility in the common 3D graphics software-for selecting attacks and propose a list of common attacks based on this criterion. Consequently, in this paper, we consider attacks like cut, change of the format, affine transformation, subdivision and small scale deformation that are usually found in the graphical software. We present several schemes to achieve robustness against these attacks. Watermark embedding is done by perturbing the vertices in their tangent space that provides us invisibility of the watermark. Hiding capacity in this method is as big as the number of the â€¦"
